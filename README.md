#### I want to build a Local Large Language Model (LLM) and learn about it in the process. The GitHub repository you shared provides a starting point for learning applied generative AI fundamentals.

Let's break down the steps to guide you through this process:

Step 1: Prerequisites
To ensure a smooth learning experience, let's cover the prerequisites:
1. Python Programming
Familiarize yourself with Python 3.x (latest version recommended)
Review basic syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.), and control structures (if-else, loops, etc.)
Practice writing Python scripts and functions
2. Basic Machine Learning Concepts
Understand the fundamentals of machine learning, including:
Supervised and unsupervised learning
Regression, classification, and clustering
Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)
Basic neural network concepts (layers, activation functions, etc.)
3. Install Required Libraries and Tools
Install Python 3.x (if you haven't already)
Install the following libraries using pip:
PyTorch (torch)
Transformers (transformers)
Hugging Face's Accelerate (accelerate)
Other dependencies listed in the repository's requirements.txt file
4. Set Up Your Development Environment
Choose a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebooks



# Step 1: Run the Ollama and OpenWebUI Containers

To run the Ollama container, use this command in your terminal:

```
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
Here’s what each part of the command does:
```

Detached Mode (-d): This runs the container in the background so you can keep using the terminal.
Volume Mount (-v ollama:/root/.ollama): It creates a Docker volume called "ollama" to store data in /root/.ollama inside the container. This way, your data stays safe even if the container stops or is deleted.
Port Mapping (-p 11434:11434): It connects port 11434 on your computer to port 11434 inside the container, letting you access Ollama’s services.
Container Name (--name ollama): This gives the container the name "ollama" so you can easily reference it later.
